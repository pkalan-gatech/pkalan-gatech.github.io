### Introduction
Accurate information is essential to good decision-making. This is especially true when relocating or investing in real estate. We propose a recommendation tool to aid in selecting a neighborhood. When relocating to a new city, what tools are available to aid in selecting a neighborhood that suits personal preferences? How can one sort through the various attributes that could impact that decision and create a rational analysis in an unfamiliar place? This question and our project could potentially affect anyone involved in searching for a new place to live, investing in real estate, or researching these topics. Currently available commercial tools (Zillow, Realtor, Trulia, Apartments.com) focus on available inventory and provide the user with some selection of limited attributes closely related to those properties but fail to consider these other essential decision attributes.
### Tool demonstration

She gives high priority to personal safety. She is interested in making new friends and date people.\
